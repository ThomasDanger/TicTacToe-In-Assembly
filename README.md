# TicTacToe-In-Assembly

`Like playing Tic-Tac-Toe on paper if it took an hour to figure out how to draw the grid`

This was fun to make. I know embedded systems programming mostly uses C, but I know some of it uses assembly and seeing as I haven't ruled out embedded systems programming as a career choice, I figured it wouldn't hurt to add this to my resume.
