# TicTacToe-In-Assembly

A tic-tac-toe program written in assembly language. This was first done in MIPS as part of a computer architecture project, 
but I am hoping to also do it in x86 soon as well

The tic-tac-toe program is against a CPU. In the first draft, the CPU is not smart. I plan to make the CPU follow the
minmax algorithm in a future update.

This program was exclusively written by me with no outside help outside of looking up the MIPS instruction set, the documentation
for system calls, and a small tutorial for how to use the modulus instruction. If this code is found anywhere outside of this
repository, it is either an expansion of my code (hopefully credited as in collaboration with me) or it was copied (hopefully
crediting me and not stolen).

If students turn this in for their project, I'm sorry, but I understand because I did this last minute for my computer architecture
project lol. Go easy on them.
